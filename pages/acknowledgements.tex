First and foremost I offer my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Gudrun Klinker for his encouragement, guidance and kind support. I also would like to give my special thanks to my advisors, Frieder Pankratz for his invaluable advice and patience.
My further thanks go to Dr. Joerg Traub, Dr. Thomas Wendler, and again Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab for providing me the opportunity to do this research project in SergicEye GmbH and Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures at Technical University of Munich. I wish also thank Stefan Wiesner, Alexander Hartl, John Michael Fischer, and other members of SergicEye and CAMP teams for their support and great time I had working with them.
Last but not least I would like to thank my family and friends for their kind support and help specially my beloved parents and my dear brother who have always been there for me.
