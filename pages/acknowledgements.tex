First and foremost I offer my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Gudrun Klinker for his encouragement, guidance and kind support. I also would like to give my special thanks to my advisor, Frieder Pankratz for his invaluable advice and patience. He spent very much time instructing me how to search literature, how to collect data and how to develop the final approach.
